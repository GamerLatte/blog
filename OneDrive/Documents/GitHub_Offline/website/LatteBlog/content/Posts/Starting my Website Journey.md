Step One:
	Get a website
	GamerLatte.com
		Used GoDaddy to get the domain
		Used Github Pages to create the initial page
			The first page (the Root of the site) MUST be named index.html.

Step Two:
	Install Obsidian
		Gonna use this to make the blog content
		Learn how to use Markdown Language

Step Three:
	Forget to install Hugo
		Install Hugo
		Observe the pretty website that's locally hosted
			Test Image:

Step Four:
	Sync the attachments
		Figure out why the attachments aren't syncing
		Ask GPT about it
			GPT has suggestions for improvements that are ultimately not helpful
		Bang head on wall...
